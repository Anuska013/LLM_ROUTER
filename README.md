🤖 LLM Router – Intelligent Prompt Classification & Multi-Model Integration
🚀 LLM Router is a system that classifies prompts and dynamically routes them to the best-fit AI model, improving efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in multi-model workflows.
🔑 Key Features
🚦 Smart Routing: Classifies prompts and sends them to the most suitable AI model.
📈 35% Accuracy Boost: Improved response quality through adaptive routing.
⚡ Latency Optimization: Reduced query time from 1.8s → 1.2s via optimized logic & parallel inference.
🔗 Multi-Model Integration: Connected 5+ AI sources with automated fallback, ensuring 99.9% uptime.
✅ Performance Validation: Tested with 1,000+ NLP cases (Q&A, summarization, creative gen).
🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, AsyncIO, REST APIs
Frontend: React (self-learned, built for visualization dashboards)
Other Tools: Prompt Engineering, Pytest, Docker
💡 Challenge & Growth
Started with no prior React experience → self-learned and built an interactive frontend for routing visualizations & model performance insights.
